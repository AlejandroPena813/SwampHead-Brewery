# SwampHead-Brewery
# Code is within the module folder.

For this project we were given a real local Gainesville client, Swamp Head Brewery, and were asked to create a web application that would be displayed in their tasting room. Using the full-stack MEAN.js my team and I developed a website that would display their daily menu for the tasting room, as well as creating the user interfaces for administrators to edit the menu items and users list (such as waiters and managers). I was the product manager of a team of 6 and am happy to say that this company still uses our application to this day.
